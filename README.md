# RSS all the things!

This repository is just a place for _very early_ brainstorming about

1. developing extensions to RSS for a variety of network-scale applications that could
   be constituted from RSS &mdash; in the way that, for example, podcasts are,
   as the base, first-class component of the application, rather than as metadata
   describing siloed websites.

2. specifying a standard sort of dynamic HTTP service that could host
   and modify components of such applications, compatibly with other
   static and existing deployments of RSS.

This proposal hopes to build on the work and ideas of [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/), 
including RSS itself, and ideas like [feed-only blogs](http://scripting.com/2023/12/11.html),
[textcasting](https://textcasting.org/), and [artcasting](http://scripting.com/2023/11/17.html).

Nothing in this repository is stable.

For now it includes:

* [Some Principle](10-Some-Principles.md)
* [Some Goals](20-Some-Goals.md)
